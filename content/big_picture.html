<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Everyone has a dream team in one’s mind, and it does not always win the championship in reality. What will be the dream team favored by 70 years of data starting from 1950? SAS, LAL, or GSW?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our goal is to find the best team and best lineup based on the latest three years in our dataset. What are the most related factors towards a team’s winning, and how do they affect the performance for each position?</p>
</div>
<div id="explanation" class="section level2">
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Our data analysis starts with exploring relationships between individual variables and looking for any potential dependencies between variables. In order to find the best variables that can successfully predict the competence of a certain team, we create a model to include every variable we think that’s most important and observe any significant predictors.</p>

<div id="wzy-model" class="section level2">
<h2>W!Z!Y! Model!</h2>
<p>This model demonstrates that variables like three point percentage and steals have huge effects on NBA results, which allow us to find out the best team.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We also analyze different positions using corresponding factors and come up with a “Dream Team” by choosing top 1 in each position to form the starting line-up and choosing second place in each position to form the substitute bench.</p>

<h2>Interactive</h2>
<p><a href="https://gwxyz.shinyapps.io/shiny_z/">This one</a> and <a href="https://gwxyz.shinyapps.io/shinyx/">that one</a> are the interactive dashboard we have.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For our first interactive dashboard, users can choose the variables for x and y axis, so that the relationship between any two variables can be easily shown on the graph. In addition, users can also select data points by brushing, the maximum and minimum value for the selected region are shown in the parenthesis. Data for all 6 variables and start season for the specific players that are selected will also be directly displayed below. This interactive program provides a general information for all the players about their performance, and the users are able to figure out whether two variables have a relationship between them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For our second interactive website, users can choose a specific year, a specific variable, and the teams among all the teams that made into the playoffs for these three years. If the chosen team didn’t made into the playoff for that particular year, then the bar chart will not change. This interactive dashboard allows users to observe the performance of those teams that they are interested in.</p>
