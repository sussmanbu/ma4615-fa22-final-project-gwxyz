<h2>Prediction</h2>
<p>For this section we used the model we made to make a prediction with the year of 2017 and came up with a table of winning index for every team in 2017. The winning index indicates the likelihood of every team winning the championship in 2017. Lastly we compared the team who has the highest winning index with the actual championship of 2017 to validate our prediction.</p>
