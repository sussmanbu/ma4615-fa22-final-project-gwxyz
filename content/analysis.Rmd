## Important Variable in NBA

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=playoff_3team_2014, aes(x=STL, fill=Tm)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  xlim(0,250) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x="Steals",title="STL of CHA, MEM, SAS for 2014 season",fill = "Team")
```
The graph shows that SAS had a higher steal mean and median than MEM and CHA. That might contribute to winning the championship.

<br>

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=playoff_3team_2014, aes(x=AST, fill=Tm)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  xlim(-100,400) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x="Assists",title="AST of CHA, MEM, SAS for 2014 season",fill = "Team")
```
Most of the players in SAS assisted more than the other two team players did, which made AST an important criteria for winning the championship. \n
 
<br>
 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=playoff_3team_2014, aes(x=VORP, fill=Tm)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  xlim(-3,8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="Value over Placement Player",title="VORP of CHA, MEM, SAS for 2014 season",fill = "Team")
```
Players in SAS had a relatively higher VORP than other players. Many of them earned 3, while players in CHA and MEM earned only about 0 and 1. It clearly shows that there are more valuable players in SAS, and that may be why it winned the championship.
 
<br>
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=playoff_3team_2016, aes(x=`3P%`, fill=Tm)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  xlim(-0.3,0.8) +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x="3 Points Percentage",title="3P% of BOS, CLE, OKC for 2016 season",fill = "Team")
```
In 2016, the 3 points percentage mean and median were higher for players in CLE than in BOS and OKC, which made 3P% a useful index to be evaluated.

  labs(title = "Average Steals of Playoffs Teams in 2013", x = "Team", y = "Steals")
```
This bar chart shows the average steals for each team in the 2013-2014 playoffs. We can see the champion team SAS get the second greatest average steals, which shows the average level of the SAS players is high this year. This also proves to us that STL is an important variable in our model.

  labs(title = "Average Assists of Playoffs Teams in 2013", x = "Team", y = "Assists")
```
This bar chart shows the average assists for each team in the 2013-2014 playoffs. The champion team SAS got the second greatest average assists, which also proves to us that AST is an important variable in our consideration.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

  stat_summary(aes(x = reorder(Tm, VORP, decreasing = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE), y = VORP), fun = mean, geom = "bar", na.rm = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Average Value over Placement Player of Playoffs Teams in 2013", x = "Team", y = "Value over Placement Player")
```
This bar chart shows the average value over placement player for each team in the 2013-2014 playoffs. The champion team SAS got the third greatest average value over placement player, which means that the players in that team this year are very good and valuable, and that also shows us that VORP is an important variable in our consideration.
 
<br> 
 
```{r, echo = FALSE} 
playoffs %>% 
  filter(SeasonStart == "2014") %>% 
  filter(Tm%in%c("CLE","BOS", "TOR", "NOP", "WAS", "BRK","CHI", "ATL","SAS",
                 "MIL","LAC","HOU","POR","GSW","MEM","DAL")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  stat_summary(aes(x = reorder(Tm, BLK, decreasing = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE), y = BLK), fun = mean, geom = "bar", na.rm = TRUE) + 
  labs(title = "Average Blocked Shots of Playoffs Teams in 2014",x = "Team", y = "Blocked Shots")
```
This chart presents the average blocked shots of Playoffs teams in 2014-2015. The champion GSW also gets a higher blocked shots than most of the other teams.

## Modeling
In this model section, our goal is trying to predict the chance of each NBA team winning the 2017 championship based on variables we believed that has the most significant contribution to a team's competence. To be able to making the most reliable model and prediction, we decide to use the most recent 3 year's data from every team for our analysis, which takes many considerations into the account, including changes in player's style, intensity of defense, rules of calls and other factors that made big difference between now day's NBA and earlier time. In order to find out strongest predictor variables, we used AIC method to investigate the significance of every variables of our interest. After the predictor variables have been determined, we then made the logistic regression that has predictor variables and the response variables which is 1 and 0 indicating whether the team we are interested in made into playoffs each year. We then used the model we made to make a prediction with year of 2017 and came up with a table of winning index for every team in 2017. Lastly we compared the team who has the highest winning index with the actual championship of 2017 and make our conclusion.

For 2014, our AIC model has given us the best predictors with the lowest AIC value of 53.63. these variables are: Player's age, steal, assist,block and three points. however, for our logistic regression, these predictors has no significant contribution to our desire model, so 2014 data may not be our best candidates for our prediction model. 
The ROC-AUC Curve tells how good our model is and based on the AUC value( 0.625), we believe that our model has moderate accuracy for the prediction.

With 2015's data, we got the best predictor variables(age, steal, assist, block) from AIC method and this time the AIC drops to 47.89. our logistic regression showed that assist and steal are significant predictors variable but the rest of predictors are still remain insignificant. The ROC-AUC Curve is better than 2014's model with the AUC value of 0.717. So we believe that this model also has moderate accuracy for the prediction and is a better choice than 2014's prediction model.

For 2016's data, we showed our AIC steps for better visualization of how we end up with our best predictors. Our AIC value dropped to 22.62 with predictor variables: age, steal, assist,block, three point and Value over Placement Player. Our logistic regression has shown multiple significant predictors and a strong ROC-AUC Curve model with the AUC value of 0.896. So we believed this will be the best candidate model for us to make the final prediction.

```
Lastly, we made our prediction on every NBA team's chance of winning the 2017 championship, the label winning index indicate the likelyhood of that team winning the champ and the table shows the top 16 teams winning index. 


## Conclusion

Our goal is to use playoff data in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to estimate the champion for 2017, and compare with the actual champion in 2017. We use histograms and density lines to analyze which factors have influence on winning a champion. We find that TS%, AST, PTS, BLK, and 3P% are the main factors. Based on this finding, we calculate the mean of each factor for each team, and create a logistic model to estimate the probability of winning the championship for that particular team. Teams that have the probabilities larger than 0.5 are considered as more likely to make into the playoffs, and the team with the largest probability will win the championship based on our prediction.


## Further Evaulation
We analyze different positions using corresponding factors and come up with a “Dream Team” by choosing top 1 in each position to form the starting line-up and choosing second place in each position to form the substitute bench. 
Point Guard is responsible for assist, passer and ball handler. Who are expected to have exceptional passing skills, ball-handling skills, make assists and play good defense against the opposing point guard. And are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. So we choose “AST” to analyze “Point Guard”
Shooting Guard’s main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense. Who are known for making shots from beyond the three-point line and being one of the primary players responsible for stealing balls on defense. So we choose “3PA” to analyze “Shooting Guard”.
Small Forward is responsible for scoring points and defending, and often are secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center. So we choose “PTS” to analyze “Small Forward”.
Power Forward is responsible for rebounding, blocking shots and defending the post, and occasionally shooting. So we choose “BLK” to analyze “Power Forward”.
Center is the most important position, as he is the last line of defense against people driving towards the basket. And they are responsible for close shots and rebounds on offense and try to block opponents’ shots and rebound their misses on defense. So we choose “ORB” to analyze “Center”.
