## Motivation and Initial Questions

* For the EDA, our initial questions are
  * What are the variables that have the most significant contribution to a team’s competence?
  * Are these variables we interested in truly increasing the chance of a team winning the championship?
  * Can we make championship predictions based on the variables we selected?
  * What type of model can we use to make the predictions, is the model reliable/accurate? 
  * What are some limitations of the model and other factors that have potential influence on our prediction?


## Modeling

In this model section, our goal is trying to predict the chance of each NBA team winning the 2017 championship based on variables we believe have the most significant contribution to a team’s competence. To be able to making the most reliable model and prediction, we decide to use the most recent 3 year’s data from every team for our analysis, which takes many considerations into the account, including changes in player’s style, intensity of defense, rules of calls and other factors that made big difference between now day’s NBA and earlier time. In order to find out the strongest predictor variables, we used the AIC method to investigate the significance of every variable of our interest. After the predictor variables have been determined, we then make the logistic regression that has predictor variables and the response variables which is 1 and 0 indicating whether the team we are interested in made into playoffs each year. Below are the steps for the model selection.

For 2014, our AIC model has given us the best predictors with the lowest AIC value of 53.63. these variables are: Player's age, steal, assist,block and three points. however, for our logistic regression, these predictors has no significant contribution to our desire model, so 2014 data may not be our best candidates for our prediction model. 
The ROC-AUC Curve tells how good our model is and based on the AUC value( 0.625), we believe that our model has moderate accuracy for the prediction.

With 2015's data, we got the best predictor variables(age, steal, assist, block) from AIC method and this time the AIC drops to 47.89. our logistic regression showed that assist and steal are significant predictors variable but the rest of predictors are still remain insignificant. The ROC-AUC Curve is better than 2014's model with the AUC value of 0.717. So we believe that this model also has moderate accuracy for the prediction and is a better choice than 2014's prediction model.

For 2016's data, we showed our AIC steps for better visualization of how we end up with our best predictors. Our AIC value dropped to 22.62 with predictor variables: age, steal, assist,block, three point and Value over Replacement Player. Our logistic regression has shown multiple significant predictors and a strong ROC-AUC Curve model with the AUC value of 0.896. So we believed this will be the best candidate model for us to make the final prediction.
