# If they don’t win the championship, who will?

## Introduction

Everyone has a dream team in one’s mind, and it does not always win the championship in reality. What will be the dream team favored by 70 years of data starting from 1950? SAS, LAL, or GSW?

<br> 
 
Our goal is to find the best team and best lineup based on the latest three years in our dataset. What are the most related factors towards a team’s winning, and how do they affect the performance for each position?


## Explanation
Our data analysis starts with exploring relationships between individual variables and looking for any potential dependencies between variables. In order to find the best variables that can successfully predict the competence of a certain team, we create a model to include every variable we think that’s most important and observe any significant predictors.


## Prediction Model
This is a logistic model and demonstrates that variables age, steal, assist, block and three points have significant effects on NBA team's competence, we can use this model to make our prediction on the NBA championship.

#logistic model
logistic_model <- glm(playoff ~ mean_age + mean_stl+ mean_ast+ mean_blk+ mean_3p,

                      family = "binomial")
summary(logistic_model)
```


## Best Team
Using the model above, we are able to obtain a table with teams that have a higher chance of winning the champion for 2017. In our prediction, the 2017 championship is most likely be SAS, which has the highest winning index, while the second highest winning index is GSW.

## Interactive

[This one]( https://gwxyz.shinyapps.io/shiny_z/) and [that one](https://gwxyz.shinyapps.io/shinyx/) are the interactive dashboard we have.

<br>

For our first interactive dashboard, users can choose the variables for x and y axis, so that the relationship between any two variables can be easily shown on the graph. In addition, users can also select data points by brushing, the maximum and minimum value for the selected region are shown in the parenthesis. Data for all 6 variables and start season for the specific players that are selected will also be directly displayed below.  This interactive program provides a general information for all the players about their performance, and the users are able to figure out whether two variables have a relationship between them.

<br>

For our second interactive website, users can choose a specific year, a specific variable, and the teams among all the teams that made into the playoffs for these three years. If the chosen team didn’t made into the playoff for that particular year, then the bar chart will not change. This interactive dashboard allows users to observe the performance of those teams that they are interested in.
