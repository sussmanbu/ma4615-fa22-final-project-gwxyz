<h2>Important Variable in NBA</h2>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" />
The graph shows that SAS had a higher steal mean and median than MEM and CHA. That might contribute to winning the championship.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" />
Most of the players in SAS assisted more than the other two team players did, which made AST an important criteria for winning the championship. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />
Players in SAS had a relatively higher VORP than other players. Many of them earned 3, while players in CHA and MEM earned only about 0 and 1. It clearly shows that there are more valuable players in SAS, and that may be why it winned the championship.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
In 2016, the 3 points percentage mean and median were higher for players in CLE than in BOS and OKC, which made 3P% a useful index to be evaluated.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
This bar chart shows the average steals for each team in the 2013-2014 playoffs. We can see the champion team SAS get the second greatest average steals, which shows the average level of the SAS players is high this year. This also proves to us that STL is an important variable in our model.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" />
This bar chart shows the average assists for each team in the 2013-2014 playoffs. The champion team SAS got the second greatest average assists, which also proves to us that AST is an important variable in our consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" />
This bar chart shows the average value over placement player for each team in the 2013-2014 playoffs. The champion team SAS got the third greatest average value over placement player, which means that the players in that team this year are very good and valuable, and that also shows us that VORP is an important variable in our consideration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="/analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" />
This chart presents the average blocked shots of Playoffs teams in 2014-2015. The champion GSW also gets a higher blocked shots than most of the other teams.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>
<p>We made a logistic regression that uses six most important variables as the predictor variables and we set response variables to 1 and 0 indicating whether the team we are interested in makes the playoffs. We then can use the model we made to make a prediction with another year that we are interested in and compare the result whether the champion that we predicted matches the actual championship of that year. The ROC-AUC Curve tells how good our model is and based on the AUC value( 0.708), we believe that our model has certain accuracy for predicting based on the variables we chose.</p>
</div>
<div id="explanation" class="section level2">
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Our goal is to use playoff data in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to estimate the champion for 2017, and compare with the actual champion in 2017. We use histograms and density lines to analyze which factors have influence on winning a champion. We find that TS%, AST, PTS, BLK, and 3P% are the main factors. Based on this finding, we calculate the mean of each factor for each team, and create a logistic model to estimate the probability of winning the championship for that particular team. Teams that have the probabilities larger than 0.5 are considered as more likely to make into the playoffs, and the team with the largest probability will win the championship based on our prediction.</p>
</div>
<div id="further-evaulation" class="section level2">
<h2>Further Evaulation</h2>
<p>We analyze different positions using corresponding factors and come up with a “Dream Team” by choosing top 1 in each position to form the starting line-up and choosing second place in each position to form the substitute bench.
Point Guard is responsible for assist, passer and ball handler. Who are expected to have exceptional passing skills, ball-handling skills, make assists and play good defense against the opposing point guard. And are often valued more for their assist totals than for their scoring. So we choose “AST” to analyze “Point Guard”
Shooting Guard’s main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense. Who are known for making shots from beyond the three-point line and being one of the primary players responsible for stealing balls on defense. So we choose “3PA” to analyze “Shooting Guard”.
Small Forward is responsible for scoring points and defending, and often are secondary or tertiary rebounders behind the power forward and center. So we choose “PTS” to analyze “Small Forward”.
Power Forward is responsible for rebounding, blocking shots and defending the post, and occasionally shooting. So we choose “BLK” to analyze “Power Forward”.
Center is the most important position, as he is the last line of defense against people driving towards the basket. And they are responsible for close shots and rebounds on offense and try to block opponents’ shots and rebound their misses on defense. So we choose “ORB” to analyze “Center”.</p>

<p>you will</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
<ul>
<li>Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?</li>
<li>What questions are you interested in answering?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breadth of the DA
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.</li>
<li>i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depth of the DA
<ul>
<li>When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well.</li>
<li>The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Modeling and Inference
<ul>
<li>You should also include some kind of formal statistical model and/or inference. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, hypothesis testing etc.</li>
<li>Explain the techniques you used for validating your results.</li>
<li>Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
<ul>
<li>Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? …</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity Figures
<ul>
<li>Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?</li>
<li>Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity of Explanations
<ul>
<li>Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?</li>
<li>How well do you explain each figure/result?</li>
<li>Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organization and cleanliness.
<ul>
<li>Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Your Data Analysis can be broken up into multiple pages if that helps with your organization.</p>
